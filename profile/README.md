_Built by community, for community_

Project Monarch it's an initiative founded by IlMelons and Rico, given the general state of FiveM where most "creators" and "developers" wear a mask that they use to make more sales and money from paid sponsors we decided to bring our vision in the community and repudiate the terms "creator" or "developer", in fact we consider ourselves simple people who love a game, our goal is to make more and more resources for servers usage and find more people like us with our ideals to bring togeter back to reality some people who have lost their minds with money and recreate the old FiveM community, the one where only people that works hard for their products earns something and where people enjoy community-created things with a less serious, entrepreneurial mindset.
